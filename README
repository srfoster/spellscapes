Okay lets prep for typescript-related contracts with a typescript backend/frontend
- Let's make it fun by modeling sugarscape (backend, frontend, and shared libraries)

* frontend is from create-react-app
* backend is from typescript-express-starter (with knex selected during creation)
* shared is homerolled with tsc defaults 


TODO:
* Make shared... 
* Link shared into frontend
* Commit the whole repo to a starter project
  - Fork off for sugarscape
